Algorithms for Genomic Data Science

Here I will describe different algorithms and best practices for Genomic Data Science.

## Part 1 (use DNA Strings notebook)
#### Basics of DNA strings
#### Given two strings we want to know what is the longest common sequence?
#### Check if two given strings are same?
#### Obtain the complementary strand of a given sequence
#### Obtain the sequence of a virus (use the lambda_virus.fa file)
#### Count the individual nucleobases in the genome
#### An example using Python's matplotlib to plot a histogram of the base counts for A, T, G, and C
